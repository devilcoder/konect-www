Here is a list of bugs on the old page of KONECT that is maintained by
the Univ. of Koblenz-Landau (Germany): 

* On the page of each bipartite network, the number of nodes is shown
  wrong:  The number of left nodes shown is actually the total number of
  nodes in the network. 
* The TSV download file for dblp_coauthor is apparently truncated (it is
  shorter than it should be).  Correct length:  89152933 bytes.  Length
  on website:  86163456.
* The definitions of the statistics extracted from the Handbook, the
  references, as well as certain parts of the tables, have encoding
  errors.   
* The largest networks have no plots and statistics, because the server
  in Koblenz did not have sufficient memory.
