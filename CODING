We use only simple HTML.

Everything is static, so you can browse the website locally, or via any
web server. 

All pages are named 'index.html', and each has its own directory.  Links
never include the 'index.html' part, but always include the trailing
slash.  Links *are* allowed to start with a slash, pointing to the root
directory of the KONECT website. 

HTML tags are in upper case to make them easier to read.

We avoid all complex HTML tags.

We don't set any font or style.

Unicode is used.  This is encoded as UTF-8 everywhere, except in the
final version in www/, where everything is converted to HTML encoding.
(We can't trust in-HTML encoding declarations, since they may be
overridden by badly configured web servers.)
