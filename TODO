* networks:  show whether the TSV can be downloaded
* statistics:  average left and right degrees
* include statistics of bipartivity
* statistic:  "own-ratio" P
* make the TSV downloadable for more datasets
** Have an icon for datasets with the data available 
* check that the 'name' of networks is unique over all networks
* check that all bipartite networks have a double 'entity-names' field,
  and that all unipartite networks have only one 
* www-specific plots:
** plots:  show sample plot for each plot type (extract them from the Handbook)
** for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot) (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
** for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
** main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 
* network:  for each statistic, show the percentile of the network for that statistic
* plots:  decomposition, decomposition_time
* networks/ table and other tables:  make it sortable
* make updates be atomic
* metadata:  add a line stating whether the network is connected or not 
* plot:  show and link to the network
