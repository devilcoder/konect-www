* on each network page:  put links to the individual plot types
* README files within downloads:  make them beautiful 
* time_histogram_signed:  for movielens-100k_rating, we seem to fail to subtract the mean rating from all weights, resuling in no negative weights shown
* time_histogram_signed:  remove all plots from plot/ that are not about signed networks. 
* for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot)
* for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic.
* labels for categories
* /categories/
* plots:  decomposition, decomposition_time
* statistics:  average left and right degrees
* statistics:  maximum left and right degrees

* tooltips everywhere
* networks/ table:  make it sortable
* make updates be atomic
* each statistic page:  also include the non-main statistics in the table, e.g., the left and right size. 
* make more datasets available 
* main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 
* list of networks:  show icons for all metadata and tags
