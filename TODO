* statistic:  smallest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian 
* left and right size of [coco]
* statistic: controllability
* statistic: mediandist
* statistic: separation
* statistic: tconflict
* statistic: signed clustering coefficient 
* statistic:  median degree 
* new statistic:  maximal egde multiplicity 
* for rating networks:  mean rating, i.e., mean edge weight
* statistic: [prefatt] pref. att. exponent
* Second largest eigenvalue of N:  spectral gap, as per Martin Gueuning 
* new node statistic:  k-core number (largest k for which a node has
  degree >0 in the k-core). (as measure of centrality).  Plot the
  corresponding distribution, the k-core distribution. 
  (matlab_bgl function core_numbers.m)
* The spectral radius divided by the spectral norm (a measure of the [a]cyclic-ness)
* Ratios:   maxdiag/opnorm, maxdiag/snorm:  they are measures of the "cyclicness" of a directed graph 
* plots:  show sample plot for each plot type (extract them from the Handbook or somewhere else)
* for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot) (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
* for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
* metadata:  add a line stating whether the network is connected or not 
* Have a page about matrix decompositions (/decompositions/)
* Have a page for selected families of networks (/families/)
* check programmatically that the 'name' of networks is unique over all networks
* in the metadata section of weighted networks:  show a line summarizing the possible weights 
* for certain statistics and plots, have references, in particular to our own
* statistics:  for each statistic, show using icons to which types of networks it applies 
* plot:  show network name, and have a link to the network (don't know how to make this beautiful)
* main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 
* network:  for each statistic, show the percentile of the network for that statistic
* networks/ table and other tables:  make it sortable (needs Javascript :/)
