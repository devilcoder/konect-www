* 'edit'
** building everything
** updating all meta.* files 

* clusco:  some networks still have a clusco shown, even though they are bipartite 
* degree and bidd plots:  include in the axis labels whether the plot in question is for in- or outdegree
* Correctly typeset the node and edge meaning 
* correct all 'entity-types' fields in meta.* files that erroneously have
  twice the same entity name.  For unipartite networks, there must be
  only a single entity name. 
* deprecate the "Folksonomy" category 

* on each network page:  put links to the individual plot types (need good layout)
* plots:  show sample plot for each plot type

* for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot)
* for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic.

== Later ==
* README files within downloads:  make them beautiful 
* plots:  decomposition, decomposition_time
* statistics:  average left and right degrees
* statistics:  maximum left and right degrees
* /categories/
* networks/ table and other tables:  make it sortable
* make updates be atomic
* each statistic page:  also include the non-main statistics in the table, e.g., the left and right size. 
* main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 
* metadata:  add a line stating whether the network is connected or not 
* make the TSV downloadable for more datasets 
* add the #incomplete tag to many more networks 
* statistics/diameter:  right align the diameter column.  (same for all number columns with similar semantics)
