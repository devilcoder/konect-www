* time_histogram plots (rename the main one to 'a')
* metadata:  add the information whether unit tests were run, and if yes whether they were run successfully 
* layout plots (PNG)
* LYBL/Delaunay plots (PNG)
* statistics:  show left and right node count (size)
* network pages:  show format and weights as pretty texts
* statistics:  show symbols for all statistics
* statistics everywhere:  show pretty names of statistics
* number formatting 
* /categories/
* tooltips everywhere
* networks/:  show a few basic statistics and metadata
* networks/ table:  make it sortable
* on each network page:  put links to the individual plot types
* README files within downloads:  make them beautiful 
* make updates be atomic
* time_histogram_signed:  for movielens-100k_rating, we seem to fail to subtract the mean rating from all weights, resuling in no negative weights shown
* time_histogram_signed:  remove all plots from plot/ that are not about signed networks. 
* plots/$plot/ pages:  insert scatter plots 
* reciprocity:  is often NaN.  why?
