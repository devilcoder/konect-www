* http://konect.cc/networks/yahoo-song/ :  the spectral norm value should not end in a '.'

* plot:   pretty names of subplots 
* each statistic page:  also include the non-main statistics in the table, e.g., the left and right size. 
* short explanation for each statistic
* www-specific plots:
** plots:  show sample plot for each plot type
** for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot) (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
** for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
* main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 

== Later ==
* add the #incomplete tag to many more networks 
* statistics/diameter:  right align the diameter column.  (same for all number columns with similar semantics)
** for assortivity and reciprocity:  left align 
* category:  explanatory text for the category 
* category:  tags for each network 
* category:  size and volume of each network 
* category:  show entity names and relationship names 
* statistics:  average left and right degrees
* include measures of bipartivity
* README files within downloads:  make them beautiful 
* plots:  decomposition, decomposition_time
* networks/ table and other tables:  make it sortable
* make updates be atomic
* metadata:  add a line stating whether the network is connected or not 
* make the TSV downloadable for more datasets
