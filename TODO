* www-specific plots:
** plots:  show sample plot for each plot type
** for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot) (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
** for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
** main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 
* category:  tags for each network 
* category:  size and volume of each network 
* category:  show entity names and relationship names 
* statistics:  average left and right degrees
* include measures of bipartivity
* network:  for each statistic, show the percentile of the network for that statistic
* plots:  decomposition, decomposition_time
* networks/ table and other tables:  make it sortable
* make updates be atomic
* metadata:  add a line stating whether the network is connected or not 
* make the TSV downloadable for more datasets
** Have an icon for datasets with the data available 
* check that the 'name' of networks is unique over all networks
* check that all bipartite networks have a double 'entity-names' field,
  and that all unipartite networks have only one 
* statistic and other pages:  always show the full "Attributes" column with all icons, like on the Networks page
